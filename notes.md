## Next Tasks - UI Improvements

**Priority: File and Image Upload UI Optimization**

The file upload and image upload features are fully functional. Next steps:

1. **Reduce UI Space for Uploads**
   - Optimize the file storage section to be more compact
   - Make image preview cards smaller/more efficient
   - Consider collapsible sections or tabs for better space management
   - Reduce padding/margins in upload preview areas

2. **Improve Upload UX**
   - Make upload indicators less intrusive
   - Consider inline previews instead of separate sections
   - Optimize for mobile/smaller screens
